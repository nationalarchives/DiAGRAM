    <p>The glossary is divided into two sections, “General terms” which has definitions for terms used across several parts of the model, and <a href="#definitions">“Definitions of nodes”</a> which covers the specific definitions developed for each risk node identified within our overall network of digital preservation risk, and the states that each node can take as part of the model.</p>

    <h1>General terms</h1>
    
    <h2>Bitstream</h2>
    
    <p>The stored set of binary information that comprises each file making up a digital object. Bits (<em>bi*nary digi*ts</em>) can be represented by 0 and 1 when presenting binary information. On storage this will be physically implemented by differing orientations of very small magnetic particles (hard drives and tapes), the presence or absence of a pit in the surface of a CD or DVD (or a different colour in the dye layer of a CD-R or DVD-R) or on/off voltage values in flash storage such as memory sticks.</p>
    
    <h2>Born-digital</h2>
    
    <p>Digital material that has only ever existed as digital objects. This includes material such as spreadsheets, word-processed documents, original digital photos from phones and digital cameras (however, if the image was of an analogue archival document that would be a surrogate). Unless an archive can specify that they will only accept certain file formats for accessioning, the file formats of born-digital material can vary widely, making the ongoing processes of digital preservation more complex. Archivists and other digital preservation specialists will require a greater range of technical skills and tools in order to be able to understand and maintain the files.</p>
    
    <h2>Digital material</h2>
    
    <p>A general term covering the three distinct types of digital material recognised in the risk model: born digital, digitised records and surrogates.</p>
    
    <h2>Digital object</h2>
    
    <p>An individual logical piece of digital material that the archive is preserving. Typically an individual digital file or set of digital files that must be preserved together in order to meaningfully preserve that piece of digital material.</p>
    
    <h2>Digitised record</h2>
    
    <p>Many of the considerations of surrogate material also apply to digitised records, such as the narrower range of file formats expected. However, in this case the original analogue material is not retained, perhaps because it has been damaged in certain ways that make it impossible to preserve (for example still image negatives or film stock that has been affected by vinegar syndrome which causes irreversible damage, and can also spread to other similar materials within the archive). This also means that the digitised version cannot subsequently be compared back to the record so additional metadata may be captured during the digitisation process in order to fully reflect the provenance of the images and capture information about information already lost from the record by the damage suffered up to that point.</p>
    
    <h2>Model</h2>
    
    <p>DiAGRAM is built on an underlying general model of digital preservation processes in the form of a Bayesian network, connecting various risk nodes via probabilities of occurrence conditional on other risks. In order to make a useful baseline model for your own archive you need to add input data that specifies particular aspects of the digital material you currently hold, and the systems and processes you have in place now. This initial baseline model will show your current risk levels. Using DiAGRAM you can then add scenarios to investigate the effect of various potential changes to your archive’s digital preservation processes and policies in order to compare the impact on your risk prevention score to help you determine the most effective strategy in your own case.</p>
    
    <h2>Node</h2>
    
    <p>Each risk to digital material identified during the development of DiAGRAM is represented by a node (displayed as an oval shape) in the Bayesian network, the arrows linking nodes show how risks influence each other, reducing or increasing the related risks.</p>
    
    <h2>Reference Model</h2>
    
    <p>A pre-set model built into DiAGRAM which can be used as a guide to benchmark your own score or as a template from which to create your own model. Currently there are two reference models that represent two extremes of digital preservation policies - we would expect most archives to be somewhere inbetween these.</p>
    
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    
    <p>Following the creation of the initial model of your own archive you can create scenarios by adjusting the input values you used in order to model possible future states of your archive. For example, how would your risk prevention score change if you were able to provide training to all your staff to improve their technical skills. Alternatively, if you focussed all your efforts on improving your information management around the digital archive, would that give you an even greater improvement. If you then add appropriate costing information to these potential interventions you can begin to build a business case to implement the desired changes.</p>
    
    <h2>State</h2>
    
    <p>Each node will have a few possible states. These represent the different options it can be. For instance, the technical skills node has two states, good and poor, and the digital object node has three states, born-digital, digitised and surrogate.</p>
    
    <h2>Surrogate</h2>
    
    <p>The typical output of a digitisation project, usually in the form of a digital image file (such as tiff, jpeg or jpeg2000), or a PDF file. If digitising audiovisual material this could also include digital video or audio files. However, the archive retains the original analogue material (on paper, parchment, film etc) which remains the original archival record. The surrogate provides more convenient access without risk of damaging the original (microfilm or facsimile copies are also forms of surrogate). Also, since the archive can influence the digitisation process and the file formats created there will typically be a narrower range of file formats found in archives of surrogate material compared to born-digital material. Also, because the original analogue material remains in the archive, it is possible to redigitise if surrogate materials are themselves damaged or lost (though there would obviously be a cost in doing this). Therefore you might be prepared to tolerate somewhat higher risks to surrogates than to unique born digital materials. If users of the archive have questions about the completeness of capture in a surrogate digitisation project, it will be possible to produce the original record.</p>

It is dictated by the application program which created the file, and the operating system under which it was created and stored (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format" target="_blank">definition from Wikipedia</a>). The file format can be described as ubiquitous if it is widely known and used by non-specialists. If the file format is not proprietary, it can be described as open. The availability of tools and software to render a digital object depends on the file format.</p>
