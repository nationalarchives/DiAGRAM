      <p>Your result has been calculated from the answers you provided to the previous questions. This shows you the probability of successfully preserving your records in terms of the two main digital preservation outcomes: renderability and intellectual control.</p>

      <p>These are defined as:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Renderability: The object is a sufficiently useful representation of the original file.</li>
        <li>Intellectual Control: Having full knowledge of the material content, provenance and conditions of use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The risk prevention probabilities below are calculated on the answers inputs you gave combined with data in the underlying network.</p>
