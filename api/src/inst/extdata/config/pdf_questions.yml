Digital_Object: |
  What proportion of your digital archive are the following?
  
  - Born Digital (Records were created in a digital format)
  
  - Digitised (Records have been created as a result of converting analogue originals, but you do not hold these originals)
  
  - Surrogate (Digital images have been created as a result of converting analogue originals, and you also hold the originals)
Checksum: |
  For what proportion of files do you have a checksum from following sources?
  
  - Yes (The depositor)
  
  - Archivist Generated (The archivist, generated on receipt of the record but prior to accessioning)
  
  - No (You don't have checksums at all, or they were generated sometime after initial receipt)
Technical_Skills: |
  The following statements on digital preservation skills are from the DigCurV curriculum framework for digital curation.
  For each, rate the level of skill in your organisation.
  
  - KIA 1.9 Apply appropriate technological solutions
  
  - KIA 1.12 Digital preservation standards
  
  - KIA 1.15 Information technology definitions and skills
  
  - KIA 1.16 Select and apply digital curation and preservation techniques
  
  - KIA 3.4 Continuously monitor and evaluate digital curation technologies
  
  - KIA 5.1 Data structures and types
  
  - KIA 5.2 File types, applications and systems
  
  - KIA 5.3 Database types and structures
  
  - KIA 5.4 Execute analysis of and forensic procedures in digital curation
  
  - PQ 3.9 Translate current digital curation knowledge into new services and tools
Storage_Medium: |
  What proportion of your records are stored on the following media types?
  
  - Less stable (Expected lifespan below 10 years or unknown, highly susceptible to physical damage, requires specific environmental conditions and very sensitive to changes, does not support error-detection methods, supporting technology is novel, proprietary and limited. Examples include USB flash drives (memory sticks), floppy disks, SD drives and CD-R discs.)
  
  - More stable (A proven lifespan of at least 10 years, low susceptibility to physical damage, tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions without data loss, supports robust error-detection methods, supporting technology is well established and widely available. Examples include LTO tapes, Blu-ray discs, enterprise/corporate managed hard drives and CD-ROM discs.)
  
  - Outsource Data Storage (An external company is responsible for our digital storage. Examples include Amazon Simple Storage Service, Microsoft Azure Archive Storage and Google Cloud Storage.)
Physical_Disaster: >
  Based on the Government's long term flood risk assessment,
  how likely is it that your safest digital storage location will experience a flood?
