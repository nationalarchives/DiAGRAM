## Using the Reference Models

To help you understand how 'good' you score is, there are two reference models already loaded into DiAGRAM which can be used as benchmarks to compare your own models against. 

The first is called 'Pre-set ref: Commercial Backup' and is based upon an Archive that has no knowledge of digital preservation but outsources their data storage of their born-digital records. They have an inventory of content but nothing more and have not thought about preserving or rendering content, only storing the bit-stream. This reference model can be used as a lower benchmark and highlights that digital preservation means a lot more than justs commercial backup. 

The second is 'Pre-set ref: Established National Archive' and represents the type of responses and score from a well-established and well-funded National Archive. There is a dedicated digital archive infrastructure to record and manage information about material. Multiple copies of the bit-stream are maintained on and off site on stable media and new copies are automatically made whenever an error is detected. Staff are experts in preservation practices and very active in digital preservation communities. The archive has reasonable control over metadata requirements from depositors. 

These reference models are both created using DiAGRAM so you can see the inputs used and high level description. We have produced additional guidance on the how the 'Commercial Backup' model was created and the reasoning behind each of the inputs which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rllUojYyZlDH4GgbMTQGn9xHiP7WPftXhxHlM9N8kdw" target="_blank" download>here</a>. 

### How can I use these?

- To understand how you're performing: These scores provide a benchmark for users to compare and assess themselves against other two other plausible digital archives. 

- As a template to create your own model: You may wish to build a model for your archive by starting from one of the reference models and adapting it to better reflect your own situation.
